We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused due to conflicts within our branches and an unexpected Git pull incident, which resulted in the removal of several branches. As a result, we had to re-upload the presentation.

We greatly appreciate your understanding and patience throughout this situation. Your support means a lot to us.

With respect,
The "Stellify" Team
